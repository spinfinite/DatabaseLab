Data Modeling
For today, you’ll be planning out a data model based on the scenario given.
You’ll be using https://www.dbdesigner.net/ and any text editor (Word, Google Docs, Pages) to complete this assignment.
Read through the scenario fully and then follow the instructions below with your partner.

Scenario
Summary
We want to create a recipe creating/sharing and grocery list app. You’ll be planning out what tables we’ll need, what information they’ll store, and how the data will relate to each other.

Features
users can sign into the app with their email and password
brainstorm: user's table that have email and password as their parameters.  Create a users table with a primary key.

users can create recipes with ingredients and instructions
brainstorm: create a table called recipes that has recipes and ingredients.  We can use the users id to keep track of which user created it. 

recipes can be marked as public or private
brainstorm: Perhaps create a boolean 1 for public and 0 for private

users can view other people’s recipes 
brainstorm: Middle 'view' table?

ingredients from recipes can be added to user’s grocery lists

users can create their own occasions and assign recipes to occasions

Part 1: Conceptual Planning - Word/Google/Pages Doc
===============
Step 1
In your doc, start a list and title it “Brainstorming”.
Take 10 minutes individually and brainstorm all the different things you might need to keep track of for this app.
Don’t worry if you repeat something or if it seems dumb as soon as you think it – write it down anyway.
Walk through some different user flows to help you think of all the data they might come across. You could also quickly sketch out some different views of the app and figure out what data would be needed for each view.

After 10 minutes, reconvene with your partner and share your ideas.
Brainstorming:
=============


Step 2
Title this next section “Table Ideas”.

Based off the ideas you just brainstormed, list out what tables you think you’ll need. It’s okay if you change it up later.

Write a brief description of each table. For example: “products: this table will hold information about the products offered, each row will be an individual product”.

Table Ideas:
Table: user will contain user_id, email, password, grocery_list
Table: recipe which will contain a recipe_id, ingredients instructions, and status
Table: occasions which will contain a recipe for the type of occasion such as a birthday.

Step 3
Next figure out what relationships should exist among the data.

Title this section “Relationships” and create 3 sub-sections as well – “one-to-one”, “one-to-many”, and “many-to-many”.

In each subsection, list the tables that have that relationship and explain why you chose that relationship.

For example, let’s say I’m planning an ecommerce app. In the one-to-many section, I could have: “products table and review table because each product can have multiple reviews, but a review is only for one specific product”.

Note: remember tables can relate to multiple other tables. In the product/reviews example above, reviews would also have a relationship with a users table. And product could be related to a cart table. There could be others as well.

Relationships:
One to One:   user table with recipe table 
One to Many:  recipe table with occasions

Step 4
Now that you know what relationships you’ll have, go back to your “Table Ideas” and in a different text color add in any additional tables and their descriptions that you’ll need.

Part 2: Table Planning - DB Designer & Word/Google/Pages Doc
Step 1 - DB Designer
Create a new schema.

Insert all your tables.

Go back through each table, figure out what columns you need, and add them in.

As you’re adding in columns, don’t forget to select the data types you want and set any primary or foreign keys.

When you’re done, go to the Schema menu and “Save As …”, then go to the Export menu and select “PDF …”.

Step 2 - Word/Google/Pages Doc
Make a new section below “Relationships” called “Columns”. Create a sub-section for each of your tables.

List out each table’s respective columns in the table’s sub-section and explain for each column:
why you’ll be storing that data and why you chose the data type you did

Relationships:
One to One:   user table with recipe table 
One to Many:  recipe table with occasions

User:
user_id: The is the unique key that each user will have.  INTEGER to increment.
email: This is the unique email each user will have.  VARCHAR at 255 characters.
password: This is the password each user will have VARCHAR at 255 characters.

Recipes:
recipe_id: a unique recipe id that will be set as an Integer
ingredients: VARCHAR as we will need characters.
status: Boolean as the users will either share or not share their recipes

Occasions:
occasion_id: an INTEGER that auto increments. 
recipe_id: a foreign key from teh Recipes table. 

Part 3: Create Tables in SQL - Postgres Sandbox & Word/Google/Pages Doc
Go to https://postgres.devmountain.com/

Write a create table statement for each of your tables
CREATE TABLE recipes (
  recipe_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  ingredients VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  status BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  recipe_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES recipes(recipe_id)
);

  CREATE TABLE occasions (
    occasion_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    recipe_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES recipes(recipe_id)
  );


Copy and paste each of the statements into your doc so you can keep track of them and turn them in

Intermediate
Try inserting some data into your tables on https://postgres.devmountain.com/
